# C-Lib
Library made for EPITECH during my FIRST YEAR

# Function Used
- Malloc ++
- Free   ++

- Write
- Open
- Read

# Features
- VECT  -> optimised array. no more malloc / free.
- LIST  -> optimised array of objects.
- DICT  -> keys of any type associated with values of any type.

Every object is associated with a type.
The type of an object is used to call every function
like compare, append, and more...

I use the attribute cleanup to simply auto_free every
object created so free is not needed anymore.

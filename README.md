# C-Lib
Library made for EPITECH during my FIRST YEAR

# Function Used from the libC
- Malloc
- Free

# Features
-- VECT --> (list of char, int, float etc...) 
-- STRT --> (list of char null terminated) 
-- LIST --> (list of objects) 
-- DICT --> (list of pairs key/value) 

Every object type is associated with an ID.
When using any function, the function acts
according to the ID type of the object used.

I use the cleanup attribut to avoid frees.

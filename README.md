# C-Lib
Library made for EPITECH during my FIRST YEAR

# Function Used from the lib C
- Malloc
- Free

# Features
- VECT - list of char, int, etc... (can be optimized a lot)  
- STRT - list of char null terminated  
- LIST - list of objects  
- DICT -> list of object pairs (key/value)  

Every object type is associated with an ID.  
When using any function, the function acts  
according to the ID type of the object used.  

I use the cleanup attribut to avoid frees.
